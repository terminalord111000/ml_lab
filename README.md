# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository explores the inner workings of **machine learning algorithms** by implementing them from scratch in Python and visualizing their behavior. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries, each model is carefully reconstructed step by step to highlight the ideas that make it work. The goal is to build a **deeper, first-hand understanding of the fundamentals** while reinforcing concepts through direct implementation.
